This is a docker container for personal use code development!

To get started, get the repo and build the docker image!

 >   git clone https://github.com/arkrp/dev-container-base.git
 >   bash ./dev-container-base/rebuild.sh

After that, whenever you need to spin up your development environment simply launch the container with launch.sh into any X11 enabled terminal.

 >   ./dev-contianer-base/launchdev.sh

 When you are done, make sure to close the container!!

 >   ./dev-container-base/stopdev.sh

The launchdev and stopdev scripts can be moved somewhere else if its convenient.

Happy experimenting!
